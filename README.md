# Tile Matcher

A Concentration-style tile-matching game, made in collaboration with [Maurice Roy](https://github.com/maurice-roy) over the course of a few days at Flatiron School. Built using vanilla JavaScript, the code could be a bit prettier and the styling could use some work, but it does what it says on the tin. The game supports multiple tilesets via a Rails API backend, found at <https://github.com/krandles/Tile-Matcher-Backend>.
